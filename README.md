# Loan Prediction Based on Customer Behavior

**This is the repository for the final project of the Rakamin Data Science Bootcamp Batch 39 that I attended. We are required to go through the end-to-end process of a data science project analyzing factors influencing the default (failure to pay) of a lending company. The original progress and result of each stage can be seen in the "Original Indonesian Version" folder, while what is displayed here is the result of the conversion from Indonesian to English, accompanied by further improvements made after the completion of the final project.**

## Problem Statement
A lending company needs to verify loan applications from its prospective borrowers (customers). The manual verification procedure conducted by the company has resulted in numerous inaccurate assessments, leading to loans being granted to borrowers who ultimately fail to repay (default). This has proven detrimental to the company as it incurs financial losses without any return. Additionally, the manual verification process also consumes a considerable amount of time.

Building on this issue, the company aims to develop an automated system that can predict the creditworthiness of prospective borrowers in the future based on past borrower data to reduce the selection of potential customers with high default risks.

## Goals
* Enhanced credit risk evaluation: Improve the assessment of credit risk by implementing machine learning models. (**MAIN**)
* Increased efficiency: Streamline the credit risk assessment process for greater effectiveness and reduced processing time. (**SECONDARY**)

## Objectives
The ultimate goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can:

* Predict credit risk with a high recall rate. The objective is to reduce the risk of losses due to inaccurate risk assessments.
* Provide automated credit risk assessment decisions in a short amount of time.

## Business Metrics
* Default Rate (%) : The percentage of prospective customers who fail to repay a loan (default) divided by the total number of customers. (**MAIN**)
* Approval Time (**SECONDARY**)
